This folder contains the results of preliminary iteration experiments as described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10333.pdf.
The images show the progress over 1000 iterations for each model starting from a training sample (shown on the very left).
The second column shows the initial reconstruction.

The video depicts the same process but starting from random noise.
